### CyberHunter is an action-packed top-down vehicular combat game inspired by the Spy Hunter by Bally Midway. Players control a futuristic, weaponized vehicle to destroy or evade enemies, and collect power-ups to enhance their arsenal.
### What sets CyberHunter apart is the inclusion of cybersecurity-themed questions, which players must solve to proceed to the next level. This unique fusion of fast-paced gameplay and educational elements creates an engaging experience that sharpens both reflexes and cyber knowledge.
